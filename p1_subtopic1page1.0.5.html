The Battle of the Wilderness took place from May 5th to May 7th of 1864. It occurred at Spotsylvania County, Virginia. This battle was the start to the Union offensive power led by General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant. As the Union’s army marched south, the Confederate General named Robert E. Lee was hopeful in fighting the enemy in the South’s own territory. The Confederates were familiar with the forest they were about to fight in. This gave them an advantage on top of the fact that The Unions larger army would not be able to dominate in a deep and overgrown forest. Two days of constant battle went on as many people died. Both sides suffered lots of casualties and the battle ended in a draw. Grant would suffer casualties of more than 18,000 men, while Lee would lose more than 11,000. However, General Grant did not retreat, and he pushed his army to keep going.			</p>

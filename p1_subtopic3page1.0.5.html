				The Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse took place shortly after the Battle of Wilderness. General Grant wanted to gain Spotsylvania courthouse before General Lee could retreat any further. Fighting began on May 8 when some Union fifth corps engaged in battle with some first corps of the Confederates at Laurel Hill on the road to the Courthouse. The South was able to hold the hill and they also extended their men to a place called Mule Shoe. On May 10, General Grant pushed three corps of men to both Laurel Hill and Mule Shoe. A 12-regiment attacking column led by Colonel Emory Upton nearly achieved success against the Confederates. Grant added more Union corps to the fight just to add on more pressure to the enemy. On the 12, Grant attacked Mule Shoe heavily, and this turned out to be one of the bloodiest parts of the war. The Confederates withdrew on the 13 of May. The Union lost about 18,000 men while the South almost lost about 12,000. The campaign continued from here.

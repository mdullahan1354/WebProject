				The Battle of Chickamauga began on September 18, 1863, and lasted for three days. General Braxton Bragg’s Confederate army was pushed out of Chattanooga and into Georgia by General William Rosecrans of the Union. But Bragg was determined to get back the city he lost, so he followed the Union North. Fighting began in earnest on the morning of the 19th near Chickamauga Creek, which was in the Georgia, Middle Tennessee-Chickamauga Watershed. Bragg’s men pushed the Union line but they held up. The battle then resumed the following day. The next day, eight new subgroups of the Army of Northern Virginia under Lieutenant  General James Longstreet pushed through the line of the Union and drove Rosecrans away from the field they fought at. This was a victory for the Confederates, but both sides did truly lose a lot. The Union lost about 16,000 men while the South lost almost about 18,500. Both armies continued to go on from here.
